INSTALLING placement
====================

QUICK and DIRTY START:
======================
Just for the fun !!!

   a/ If not already done, install python3 and numactl
   b/ You can copy-and-paste the following:
      cd where/you/downloaded/placement
      yes Y | ./install.sh
      cd etc; 
      cp placement.conf-dist placement.conf; 
      sed --in-place -e "s/HOSTNAME/$(hostname -s)/" placement.conf
   c/ try it:
   
      ~/placement/bin/placement 4 4 --ascii
      S0-------- S1-------- 
      P AAAABBBB.. CCCCDDDD.. 

THE COMPLETE STORY:
===================

1/ Prerequisites: 
    -placement needs python 3.5.x or better
    -The package: numactl must be installed on the system
    -It is better if slurm is installed on your system, but slurm is NOT required
        If slurm is not installed, the switches --chekme and --jobid will not be available
    -When you are running a job on a cluster, you should be able to ssh to the working node
     to be able to use placement --checkme or any other --check option

2/ Execute the installation script:
   ./install.sh                      ==> Installing in your home: ~/placement

   or

   ./install.sh /usr/local/placement ==> Installing in the directory /usr/local/placement

   In the following, $PLACEMENT_ROOT means "the placement directory"
   
   NOTE - placement can be installed in the download directory, ie you can download placement to ~/placement,
          then install the program in the same directory.
          However, this is not recommanded

3/ Configuration:
   cd $PLACEMENT_ROOT/etc
   cp placement.conf-dist $placement.conf
   Edit placement.conf to configure placement to your needs:
        -In the FIRST part of placement.conf you must describe the different node types you have on your cluster
         At least ONE type should be described here
         You describe the number of sowkets, the number of cores/socket, the presence/absence of a GPU, etc.
         
        -In the SECOND part of placement.conf you must connect each node (through its name returned by hostname -s)
         to its type as previousliy described

   See placement.conf-dist for the details

4/ Binary:
   cp $PLACEMENT_ROOT/bin/placement-dist $PLACEMENT_ROOT/bin/placement
   Edit $PLACEMENT_ROOT/bin/placement, the only thing to change is:
      - A command to get python3 working (using gnu module for instance)
      - The path to python3
    
   Create a symbolic link from a directory in the path:
       cd /usr/local/bin; ln -s $PLACEMENT_ROOT/bin/placement

   OR

   copy the file placement to some directory in the path:
       cd /usr/local/bin; cp $PLACEMENT_ROOT/bin/placement .
       
   OR
   
   Call placement using the complete path:
       $PLACEMENT_ROOT/bin/placement
     
START USING placement:
======================
   placement --documentation   | less   # read the doc !
   placement --documentation 7 | less   # read only from Section 7
   placement --help                     # shorter but helpful doc
   

Have fun !

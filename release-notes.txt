v 1.10.0
--------
    In the threads representation (--check, --host etc), we now display the Session Id
    Processes are sorted using the session id as key
    This is very useful for shared nodes

v 1.9.0
-------
    Support for shared nodes is back
   
v 1.8.0
-------
    External binaries are called through ssh on remote nodes, this is required 
    by some supercomputers
    Bugguy support for share nodes removed    

v 1.7.0
-------
    New cores addressing supported (encountered on Dell servers for instance)
    placement --make_mpi_aware is only useful with slurm, on a SHARED node
    So you can use directly --mpi_aware
    
v 1.6.0
-------
    Now need python3 (3.5.x min)
    Error messages now on stderr, no more stdout -> better log files in slurm.out
    --check = May display up to 296 tasks, thanks to utf8 outputs !
    GPU = display processes known by the gpus and memory used

v 1.5.0
-------
    Introducing the --summary switch (still experimental)
    --no_ansi may be useful with --summary
    Redesigned the --check output

v 1.4.0
-------
    Support for the GPU
    With --checkme: we display only the first node, even if we have a lot of reserved nodes

v 1.3.0
-------
    Trying to guess architecture from slurm.conf
    Added mpi_aware mode

v 1.2.0
-------
    --intel_affinity and --gnu_affinity switches
    --memory with --check to display memory consumption of the processes 
    --Better display with --check
    
v 1.1.0
------
    Refactoring for a better code
    Unit tests added to the git repository
    Added switches --check and --checkme
    Added switches --srun and --numactl

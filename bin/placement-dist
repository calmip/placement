# ================ The following should not be changed =====================

# Useful if the environment is not utf8 based
# One trivial example: LANG="C"
# LANG="C" placement --jobid xxx where the gpus are used will not work without this variable
# See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47968578/python3-utf-8-decode-issue
export PYTHONIOENCODING=utf8 

# The PLACEMENT_ROOT env variable (should be correctly set by the install script)
export PLACEMENT_ROOT=PROOT

# The PLACEMENT_EXTERNALS env variable = Some useful external programs 
export PLACEMENT_EXTERNALS=PEXT

# The PYTHONPATH env variable
export PYTHONPATH=$PLACEMENT_ROOT/lib:$PYTHONPATH

# Real path to this script
export PLACEMENTBASH=$(realpath $0)

# Path to the python program
export PLACEMENTPY=$PLACEMENT_ROOT/lib/placement.py

# Calling the python main script
exec $PLACEMENT_PYTHON $PLACEMENTPY $*
